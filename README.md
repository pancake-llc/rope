# What
Let’s first acknowledge that rope is used pretty sparingly in video games, with good reason:
- It’s computationally expensive to simulate.
- It’s cognitively expensive to develop.
- Using physically-based rope for anything remotely interesting is full of edge cases and other hurdles.
- It can be a pain to render.
